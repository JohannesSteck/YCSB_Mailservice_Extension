This is a extentions to support a mailservice workload for ycsb.
Supported DBs are Cassandra and DynamoDB. Works only with custom DBClients for both DBs, which are available in this repository. Custom mailservice workload files are included in the "workloads" directory.

To use this extension, get the original YCSB from its git repository (https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB)

To do mailservice workload benchmarks with either Cassandra or DynamoDB:
- integrate the "core" folder of this extension into the original "YCSB/core" folder

To do Cassandra benchmarks with the mail workload:
- integrate the contents of the extension cassandra folder into the original "//YCSB/cassandra" folder.
- delete the classes "CassandraClient8.java" and "CassandraClient7.java" contained in "//YCSB/cassandra/src/main/java/com/yahoo/ycsb/db/"

To do DynamoDB benchmarks with the mail workload:
- integrate the contents of the extension "dynamodb" folder into the original "//YCSB/dynamodb" folder.

Perform "mvn clean package" to build YCSB with the mailservice workload extension

Alter the workload files in "//YCSB/workloads" to your needs 
	Check if the right WorkloadExecutor class is selected in the workload file:
		"workload=com.yahoo.ycsb.workloads.MailAppCassandraWorkload"
	or
		"workload=com.yahoo.ycsb.workloads.MailAppDynamoDBWorkload"
